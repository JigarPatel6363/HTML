            At one time, it was believed that Jamshedji Tata was inspired to build this hotel after he was refused entry at Watsons Hotel, which was restricted to whites only. However, this story has often been challenged by various commentators who claim that Jamshedji had built this grand hotel to gift the people a royal experience worthy of Bombay.
            The Indian architects originally on the project for the Taj were Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya and D. N. Mirza; however, it was completed by an English engineer, W. A. Chambers. Khansaheb Sorabji Ruttonji Contractor was the builder of this grand hotel, and the unique floating staircase of the Taj was his design. Construction of the Taj cost over Rs. 4 crores. The hotel is a six-story building with a central Moorish dome and magnificent architecture of the Indo-Saracenic style. This royal palatial building is carved with Victorian Gothic and Romanesque details along with Edwardian touches on the roof. The hotel boasts of many firsts in the Indian hospitality industry it used American fans, German elevators, Turkish baths and English butlers to give the people of its city an experience like no other hotel in the country.</p>
